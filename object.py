# in python everything is object.
# object is collection of attribute and behaviour
# to create own project we use class keyword
# class is blueprint of object

class Demo:
    pass #just like return

x= Demo()
print(type(x))

# inside class currently we have only pass but we can define class attributes and methods.

# attributes: it is a state/characteristics of an object.
# method: it is an operation we can perform with the object.

# example:
# we can create a class called dog. An attribute of a dog maybe its breed,name while a method of a dog maybe defines by .bark() method which return the sound.
